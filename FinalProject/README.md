## Trading System

Develop a bond trading system for US Treasuries with seven securities: 2Y, 3Y, 5Y, 7Y, 10Y, 20Y, and 30Y. Look up the CUSIPS, coupons, and maturity dates for each security. Ticker is T.
We have a new definition of a Service in soa.hpp, with the concept of a ServiceListener and Connector also defined. A ServiceListener is a listener to events on the service where data is added to the service, updated on the service, or removed from the service. A Connector is a class that flows data into the Service from some connectivity source (e.g. a socket, file, etc) via the Service.OnMessage() method. The Publish() method on the Connector publishes data to the connectivity source and can be invoked from a Service. Some Connectors are publish-only that do not invoke Service.OnMessage(). Some Connectors are subscribe-only where Publish() does nothing. Other Connectors can do both publish and subscribe.
Use the base classes in tradingsystem.zip attached to this thread. You should define the following bond specific classes:
BondTradeBookingService
BondPositionService
BondRiskService
BondPricingService
BondMarketDataService
BondExecutionService
BondStreamingService
BondAlgoExecutionService (no base class – you should create this from scratch)
BondAlgoStreamingService (no base class – you should create this from scratch)
GUIService (no base class – you should create this from scratch)
BondInquiryService
BondHistoricalDataService

The following services below should read data from a file in a separate process and publish the data via socket into the trading system – you should create sample data as outlined below. You should read data from the file via a Connector subclass and publish via socket in another Connector. There should then be an inbound Connector in the trading system to read from the socket, which should then flow data into the relevant Service via the Service.OnMessage() method.

Note that you should use fractional notation for US Treasuries prices when reading from the file and writing back to a file in the BondHistoricalDataService (with the smallest tick being 1/256th). Example of fractional is 100-xyz, with xy being from 0 to 31 and z being from 0 to 7 (you can replace z=4 with +). The xy number gives the decimal out of 32 and the z number gives the remainder out of 256. So 100-001 is 100.00390625 in decimal and 100-25+ is 100.796875 in decimal.

Note that output files should have timestamps on each line with millisecond precision.

BondPricingService
This should get data from prices.txt (again, with a separate process reading from the file and publishing via socket into the trading system, which populates via a Connector into the BondPricingService). Create 1,000,000 prices for each security (so a total of 7,000,000 prices across all 7 securities). The file should create prices which oscillate between 99 and 101, moving by the smallest increment each time up from 99 and then down from 101 (bearing in mind that US Treasuries trade in 1/256th increments). The bid/offer spread should oscillate between 1/128 and 1/64.

BondTradeBookingService
This should read data from trades.txt (again, with a separate process reading from the file and publishing via socket into the trading system, which populates via a Connector into the BondTradeBookingService). Create 10 trades for each security (so a total of 70 trades across all 7 securities) in the file with the relevant trade attributes. Positions should be across books TRSY1, TRSY2, and TRSY3. The BondTradeBookingService should be linked to a BondPositionService via a ServiceListener and send all trades there via the AddTrade() method (note that the BondTradeBookingService should not have an explicit reference to the BondPositionService though or vice versa – link them through a ServiceListener). Trades for each security should alternate between BUY and SELL and cycle from 1000000, 2000000, 3000000, 4000000, and 5000000 for quantity, and then repeat back from 1000000. The price should oscillate between 99.0 (BUY) and 100.0 (SELL).

BondPositionService
The BondPositionService does not need a Connector since data should flow via ServiceListener from the BondTradeBookingService. The BondPositionService should be linked to a BondRiskService via a ServiceListenher and send all positions to the BondRiskService via the AddPosition() method (note that the BondPositionService should not have an explicit reference to the BondRiskService though or versa – link them through a ServiceListener).

BondRiskService
The BondRiskService does not need a Connector since data should flow via ServiceListener from the BondPositionService.

BondMarketDataService
This should read data from marketdata.txt (again, with a separate process reading from the file and publishing via socket into the trading system, which populates via a Connector into the BondMarketDataService). Create 1,000,000 order book updates for each security (so a total of 7,000,000 prices) each with 5 orders deep on both bid and offer stacks. The top level should have a size of 10 million, second level 20 million, 30 million for the third, 40 million for the fourth, and 50 million for the fifth. The file should create mid prices which oscillate between 99 and 101, moving by the smallest increment each time up from 99 and then down from 101 (bearing in mind that US Treasuries trade in 1/256th increments) with a bid/offer spread starting at 1/128th on the top of book (and widening in the smallest increment from there for subsequent levels in the order book). The top of book spread itself should widen out on successive updates by 1/128th until it reaches 1/32nd, and then decrease back down to 1/128th in 1/128th intervals (i.e. spread of 1/128th at top of book, then 1/64th, then 3/128th, then 1/32nd, and then back down again to 1/128th, and repeat).

BondAlgoExecutionService
This should be keyed on product identifier with value an AlgoExecution object. The AlgoExecution should be a class with a reference to an ExecutionOrder object. BondAlgoExecutionService
should register a ServiceListener on the BondMarketDataService and aggress the top of the book, alternating between bid and offer (taking the opposite side of the order book to cross the spread) and only aggressing when the spread is at its tightest (i.e. 1/128th) to reduce the cost of crossing the spread. It should send this order to the BondExecutionService via a ServiceListener and the ExecuteOrder() method. Execute on the entire size on the market data for the right side you are executing against (remember, you are crossing the spread).

BondAlgoStreamingService
This should be keyed on product identifier with value an AlgoStream object. The AlgoStream should be a class with a reference to a PriceStream object. BondAlgoStreamingService
should register a ServiceListener on the BondPricingService and send the bid/offer prices to the BondStreamingService via a ServiceListener and the PublishPrice() method. Alternate visible sizes between 1000000 and 2000000 on subsequent updates for both sides. Hidden size should be twice the visible size at all times.

GUIService
This should be keyed on product identifier with value a Price object (from PricingService). The GUIService is a GUI component that listens to streaming prices that should be throettled. Define the GUIService with a 300 millisecond throttle. You only need to print the first 100 updates. It should register a ServiceListener on the BondPricingService with the specified throttle, which should notify back to the GUIService at that throttle interval. The GUIService should output those updates with a timestamp with millisecond precision to a file gui.txt.

BondExecutionService
The BondExecutionService does not need an input Connector since data should flow via ServiceListener from the BondAlgoExecutionService. Each execution should result in a trade into the BondTradeBookingService via ServiceListener on BondExectionService – cycle through the books above in order TRSY1, TRSY2, TRSY3. The BondExecutionService should use a Connector to publish executions via socket into a separate process which listens to the executions on the socket via its own Connector and prints them when it receives them.

BondStreamingService
The BondStreamingService does not need an input Connector since data should flow via ServiceListener from the BondAlgoStreamingService. The BondStreamingService should use a Connector to publish streams via socket into a separate process which listens to the streams on the socket via its own Connector and prints them when it receives them.

BondInquiryService
You should read inquiries from a file called inquiries.txt with attributes for each inquiry with state of RECEIVED (again, with a separate process reading from the file and publishing via socket into the trading system, which populates via a Connector into the BondInquiryService). You should create 10 inquiries for each security (so 70 in total across all 7 securities). You should register a ServiceListener on the BondInquiryService which sends back a quote when the inquiry is in the RECEIVED state. The BondInquiryService should send a quote of 100 back to a Connector via the Publish() method. The Connector should transition the inquiry to the QUOTED state and send it back to the BondInquiryService via the OnMessage method with the supplied price. It should then immediately send an update of the Inquiry object with a DONE state. Then it moves on to the next inquiry from the file and we repeat the process.

BondHistoricalDataService
This service should register a ServiceListener on the following: BondPositionService, BondRiskService, BondExecutionService, BondStreamingService, and BondInquiryService. It should persist objects it receives from these services back into files positions.txt, risk.txt, executions.txt, streaming.txt, and allinquiries.txt via special Connectors for each type with a Publish() method on each Connector. There should be a BondHistoricalDataService corresponding to each data type. When persisting positions, we should persist each position for a given book as well as the aggregate position. When persisting risk, we should persist risk for each security as well as for the following bucket sectors: FrontEnd (2Y, 3Y), Belly (5Y, 7Y, 10Y), and LongEnd (20Y, 30Y). Use realistic PV01 values for each security.
